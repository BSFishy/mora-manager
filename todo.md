- [ ] pass the service definition or whatever directly to the kube deployment.
      this will help when adding new properties and all that
- [ ] make wingmen just another service definition. this is so that i dont need
      to specify a whole separate but the same config for wingmen, i can just reuse
      the same config and all that from services but for wingmen
